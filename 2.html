          <h2>Fossils: friend or foe?</h2>
          <p>
            We palaeontologists like to think that it's impossible to reconstruct early evolution without recourse to the fossil record.
            But could the mounting array of genetic data provide a more reliable picture of life's history – 
            and could the fossil record even be actively misleading?

                <p>Our introduction to this topical topic is a landmark paper by Sansom <i>et al.</i>

                By simulating the process of fossilization, Sansom and colleagues shows that artificial fossils of modern
                "fish" might end up being mis-classified in phylogenetic analyses.</p>

              <p>
                Before reading this paper you should brush up on some key phylogenetics concepts.
                Berkley's <a href="https://evolution.berkeley.edu/the-tree-room/evolutionary-trees-a-primer/" target="_blank">primer
                articles</a> are a good place to start; in particular the sections "Evolutionary trees: A primer" and "How to build a tree".
                The canonical reference for the enthusiastic is Felsenstein's comprehensive <i>Inferring phylogenies</i> (2004).

              <h3>Reading the paper</h3>
              <p>
                You should use this course as an opportunity to develop the skill of scientific reading.
                Many people recommend reading only the abstract, introduction and conclusion on a first pass,
                then looking through the figures, and only then reading the paper in sequence.
                I have had some success with the 
                "<a href="https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2008/02/18/monday-master-class-rapid-note-taking-with-the-morse-code-method/" target="_blank">Morse Code method</a>".
                Discuss techniques with others in your group, and with your demonstrator.                
              </p>
              <p>
                After reading the paper, ask yourself a few questions to see how well you understood it.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    What's the overall topic that the study is trying to address?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    What were the major views on this topic before this work?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    What are the authors trying to argue? What is their evidence?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    What assumptions do the authors make?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    What do you have to assume to get to the results from the conclusions?  Do these assumptions hold?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    What aspects of the argument did you find most convincing? Least convincing?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    How did you feel when reading the paper?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    How has the paper moved on our understanding?
                    What new questions does it raise – and what practical implications does it have?
                    How might its results be tested or developed further?

              <h3>Discussing the paper</h3>
              <p>
                In the in-class session, your group and one other will discuss the paper's strengths and weaknesses
                and implications for the larger question of whether fossils are reliable.
                Besides reading the paper individually, you might also want to quickly look at some related papers to get
                a broader context for the work and for how it has been received.
                Perhaps you could identify three or four key papers as a group, and skim one or two each?

                Some easy ways to find related literature are:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Use <a href="https://scholar.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a>
                    to search for the article.  Look at the citing articles ("Cited by 123"),
                    or use the "<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Non-random+decay+of+chordate+characters+causes+bias+in+fossil+interpretation&btnG=#:~:text=Related%20articles,-All%20" target="_blank">Related articles</a>" link.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Search for the article in <a href="https://www.connectedpapers.com/main/e7ae9a11134717477b40c75ab21f668351479e1f/Non%20random-decay-of-chordate-characters-causes-bias-in-fossil-interpretation/graph" target="_blank">Connected papers</a>.

                          <p>
                          AD: I would perhaps start with 'blind' searches perhaps with the terms: fossils enrich; fossil bias; fossils mislead; "fossils are essential to"; fossils inadequate. I would probably follow these search queries with the same terms but with "origin of" <span style="font-size: smaller">(including the "'s which tell google to search for the exact phrase)</span> if the terms did not lead to papers that are pertinent to the question which addresses the evolutionary origins of living groups.
                          </p><p>
                          The title and abstract should be sufficient to figure out if the paper is worth reading at all (many will not be).</p>
                          <p>It is also worth considering if the paper you're reading is 'seminal' or at the periphery of a topic. The citation count may indicate this but reading the introduction is useful to gauge similar work, and should cite the most important papers in that sub-field.
                          </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>
                            AB: For either side of the motion, I would think consider an initial case or argument that I could make. For the proposer, I would think “where have fossils been useful”, using a case study as a reference point. My mind would go to “transition fossil”, as these provide a type of evidence unavailable elsewhere. For the opposer, I would reflect on what the/an alternative would be if not fossils, i.e. molecular data. Hence, as an initial reference point I would search for “morphological vs molecular data” (or “fossil vs genetic data”), aiming to find pre-existing literature that makes comparisons from a quality-of-data perspective, and refine terminology as appropriate.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            In both cases, I would also put a general “use of fossils” to see how they are used in studies and what information is derived from them, and consider the case for/against using them from there (again refining as appropriate). A further, perhaps more technical, phrase could be “fossils tree resolution” to see if fossils help with this in particular as this could be relevant for questions of group origins (evidence on both sides).

              <h3>The debate</h3>
              <p>
                The debate will follow a structure in which a member of each team in turn puts forwards an 
                uninterrupted ~five minute statement that helps to build the argument.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each team should open with an <strong>opening statement</strong> that puts forwards the outline of their argument in a clear and attention-grabbing way.  The subsequent team member(s) will deliver the <strong>primary arguments</strong>, expanding on the arguments with specific evidence that builds a coherent case.
                The final speaker on each team will provide a <strong>closing statement</strong> that rebuts any arguments presented by the opposing team before summarizing the argument for the team's own position.
              </p>
              <p>
                You will then have the opportunity to put questions to members of the opposite team – 
                and your demonstrator may also weigh in with queries to the floor.
                Be sure to take notes and prepare incisive questions whilst listening to the other team's "speeches". 
              </p>
              <h4>Preparing your statements</h4>
              <p>
                The <strong>opening statement</strong> is a logical place to define your terms – for instance,
                what is meant by the Cambrian explosion, and why do we think it happened?  It also gives an opportunity to pre-empt potential counter-arguments: "Even though some people think X, we really know that Y".
              </p>
              <p>
                When summarizing your arguments in the <strong>closing statement</strong> you might identify where apparent disagreements boil down to differences in definitions, rather than in substance; this is also your first opportunity to refute any arguments made by the opposite team.
