          <p>
            Now it's your turn to explore an active question in palaeontology.
            Your group will select an open controversy and summarise its significance and the state of the art,
            equipping other students to draw their own conclusions on the topic.

                Your task now is to get to grips with the literature on your chosen topic.
                You should by now be familiar with the sorts of questions to ask when interrogating the literature:
                What are the primary viewpoints?  What data back them up?  Are the conclusions supported by the evidence?
                What assumptions are made?

                Your first task is to get a handle on your topic.
                Read current literature in order to summarize:
                <ul>
                  <li>the context of your topic (i.e. why is it an interesting question);</li>
                  <li>each major viewpoint or perspective; and</li>
                  <li>
                    the implications of the conclusion for science more generally
                    (e.g. "If X, then this raises the question of whether we can trust the fossil record to
                    address other questions of nature Y").
                  </li>

                You must ultimately identify the two (or more) main viewpoints on the controversy,
                and decide which you will choose to represent.
                Your group will create a "microsite" that concisely articulates and defends your
                chosen perspective on your topic.

                Previous years have found 
                <a href="https://sites.google.com/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Sites</a>
                to be best suited to this task.
                Your objective is to equip a lay reader to appreciate the key points about your topic,
                and to give easy pointers to the best places to go for more detail.

                Back in the paper age, we might have asked you to present this information as an A0 poster.
                Even though a digital format doesn't impose the same size constraint, this should be your guide
                to the level of detail you are aiming to include: we want a clear narrative that can
                be digested in five to ten minutes.  
                Your site should comprise a single page and be designed for reading on a computer display.
                Attractive visuals and a clear layout are a plus 
                where they add to the story, but shouldn't distract from the main content.

                You should bring a draft of your site into the session on <span style="font-weight: bold;" week="8"></span>,
                where you will receive feedback from the teaching team.
                On <span style="font-weight: bold;" week="9"></span> you will present your final microsite to your peers,
                giving a five-to-ten minute walkthrough of the site, and answering any questions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your peers are the ultimate audience for your microsite.
                In your Essay assignment, you will argue the opposite side to the positions presented
                by a group of your choosing.  Your own microsite must therefore stand up to
                this scrutiny, pre-empting the arguments that your critics may put forth.

                The final week of term, <span week="10"></span>, will provide an opportunity to discuss
                others' topics in more depth.  This final session will be a "surgery" open to further
                questions on any topic, to be fielded by the teaching team alongside the experts – 
                namely, your peers who have studied particular topics in depth!
