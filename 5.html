            What are the origins of animal biodiversity?  On one view, complex animal-dominated ecosystems appeared in the blink of a geological eye a the dawn of the Phanerozoic.  But detractors argue that this Cambrian &lsquo;explosion&rsquo; is an artefact of the fossil record, and the animal phyla diverged closer to a billion years ago.

                  Our introduction to this topic is a widely cited paper by Cunningham <i>et al.</i> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.201600120" target="_blank">BioEssays, 2017</a>).
                  This review seeks to explain the discrepancy between the fossil record of early animals and the predictions of molecular clocks.

              <p>
                The paper brings together a range of lines of evidence to present a holistic take on the Cambrian explosion.
                You don't need to be expert in all of them, but it might be worth arranging for one member of your group to explore each key type of data addressed in detail by the paper.  You might find a primer on <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-molecular-clock-and-estimating-species-divergence-41971/" target="_blank">molecular clocks</a> useful.

              <h3>Discussing the paper</h3>
              <p>
                In the in-class session, your group and one other will discuss the paper's strengths and weaknesses
                and implications for the larger question of whether fossils are reliable.
                Besides reading the paper individually, you might also want to quickly look at some related papers to get
                a broader context for the work and for how it has been received.
                Perhaps you could identify three or four key papers as a group, and skim one or two each?
              </p>
              <p>
                You're now more than capable of finding relevant reading for yourselves,
                but if you'd like an initial recommendation,
                Graham Budd is behind some of the most insightful perspectives on the Cambrian Explosion, even if aspects of his papers can require singificant thought in order to fully understand.
                Budd & Jensen 2000 remains <em>the</em> paper on how to read the Cambrian explosion;
                Budd & Mann 2020 offers a subtle but provocative appraisal of molecular clocks.

          <p>
            In the second of these two sessions, we'll widen our frame of reference to discuss the broader question: What is really represented by the Cambrian explosion?

              <h3>Preparation</h3>
              <p>
                Your group of three or four will be assigned to argue for or against the motion
                "The Cambrian &lsquo;explosion&rsquo; is an artefact of the fossil record".
                Working in groups allows you to sample a broader selection of the literature than you could alone.
              </p><p>
                As a team, identify a list of papers that look relevant to the question.
                Dividing these among yourselves, try to understand and then summarise the key arguments on both sides
                of the debate.
                What will your opponents assert, and what are the counter-arguments?
                What is the strongest evidence in favour of your assigned position?  How might your opponents attack these, and how could you respond?                
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-4 col-12-narrow featured">

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-8 col-12-narrow">
              <h3>The debate</h3>
              <p>
                The debate will follow a structure in which a member of each team in turn puts forwards an 
                uninterrupted ~five minute statement that helps to build the argument.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each team should open with an <strong>opening statement</strong> that puts forwards the outline of their argument in a clear and attention-grabbing way.  The subsequent team member(s) will deliver the <strong>primary arguments</strong>, expanding on the arguments with specific evidence that builds a coherent case.
                The final speaker on each team will provide a <strong>closing statement</strong> that rebuts any arguments presented by the opposing team before summarizing the argument for the team's own position.
              </p>
              <p>
                You will then have the opportunity to put questions to members of the opposite team – 
                and your demonstrator may also weigh in with queries to the floor.
                Be sure to take notes and prepare incisive questions whilst listening to the other team's "speeches".
